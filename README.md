## üöÄ How To Use

Ready to get Ecovision up and running? Follow these steps to set up your development environment and launch the platform.

### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Git**: Essential for cloning the project repository.
* **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed, along with its package installer, **Pip**.
* **Node.js**: Install Node.js, which includes **npm** (Node Package Manager) for managing frontend dependencies.

### **Installation**

Let's get the project files onto your machine and install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the Ecovision project from its GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alirezaArz/Ecovision.git](https://github.com/alirezaArz/Ecovision.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Root:**
    Change your current directory to the newly cloned project's main folder:

    ```bash
    cd Ecovision
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages for the Django backend using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Move into the `frontend` directory and install the React application's dependencies using `npm`:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

### **Running the Development Servers**

Ecovision involves both a Django backend (which includes AI scripts) and a React frontend. Here's how to start them.

#### **Running the Django Backend & AI Scripts**

From the main `Ecovision` directory, execute the following command to launch the Django server and simultaneously activate the integrated AI scripts:

```bash
python manage.py starteco
````

  * **Setting a Custom Port:**
    By default, the Django server runs on port `8000`. If you need to use a different port, you can specify it with the `--port` argument:

    ```bash
    python manage.py starteco --port <your port>
    ```

    *Note: Changing the default port (8000) will require manual configuration adjustments for buttons on the main page or Admin Page, as they are hardcoded to the default.*

  * **Accessing the Main Page:**
    To open the `Main Page`, simply [click here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

  * **Accessing the Admin Page:**
    To open the `Admin Page`, simply [click here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).

#### **Running the React Frontend**

To start the React development server, navigate into the `frontend` directory (if you're not already there) and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This will typically open the React application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

### **Viewing Logs**

To monitor the output and logs generated by the backend processes (Django and AI scripts), use the following command from the main `Ecovision` directory:

```bash
python manage.py ecolog
```
